# Home-Automation

# INTRODUCTION
IoT based home automation is one of the best means for controlling the overall home load on the smart phone through Internet. The word automation means making the use of machinery instead of human efforts as well as it may be defined as the technique of making an apparatus, a process, or a system that operates automatically.
Nowadays, home automation is used more and more. On the other hand, it provides increased comfort especially when everyone busy with their work. It does not only increase comfort but also allows centralized control of heating, ventilation, air-condition, and lightning. Hence, they contribute to overall cost reduction and also useful in energy saving which is certainly the main problem today.
The use of wireless technologies gives several advantages that could not be achieved using a wired network only.

# MAIN COMPONENTS USED
## 1. NodeMCU:
 NodeMCU is based on the ESP8266-12E WIFI System-On-Chip, loaded with an open source, Lua-based firmware. The board is perfect for IoT application and other Situation where wireless connectivity is required. It has microcontroller-equipped prototyping boards which can be programmed using the Arduino IDE.![Nodemcu]

## NodeMCU ESP8266 Specifications & Features

*  • Microcontroller: Tensilica 32-bit RISC CPU Xtensa LX106 • Operating Voltage: 3.3V • Input Voltage: 7-12V • Digital I/O Pins (DIO): 16 • Analog Input Pins (ADC): 1 • UARTs: 1 • SPIs: 1 • I2Cs: 1 • Flash Memory: 4 MB • SRAM: 64 KB • Clock Speed: 80 MHz • USB-TTL based on CP2102 is included onboard, Enabling Plug n Play • PCB Antenna • Small Sized module to fit smartly inside your IoT projects


## 2. Relay: 
The relay is the device that open or closes the contacts to cause the operation of the other electric control. It works on the principle of an electromagnetic attraction. When the circuit of the relay senses the fault current, it energies the electromagnetic field which produces the temporary magnetic field. The magnetic field moves the relay armature for opening or closing the connections. The small power relay has only one contacts, and the high power relay has two contacts for opening the switch.

## 3. Google Firebase:
 Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. Firebase provides number of services, including: analytics, authentication, cloud messaging, realtime database, crashlytics, performance, test lab.
We are using two services of the firebase:-
• Realtime database:- The firebase realtime database is a cloud hosted NoSQL database that enables data to be stored and synced between users in real time. The data is synced across all clients in the real time and is still available when an app goes offline.
• Test Lab:- Firebase Test Lab is a cloud-based app-testing infrastructure. With one operation, developers can test their iOS or Android apps across a variety of devices and devices configurations. They can see the results, including videos, screenshots and logs, in the firebase console.
## 4. MIT App Inventor:
 MIT App Inventor is a programming learning tool that is aimed at total beginners but also novices wishing to advance further. It came about as a collaboration between Google and MIT. It uses coding to create real-world usable apps for Android and iOS devices.

## Conclusion
The main purpose of home automation system is to provide ease to people to control different home appliances with the help of the android application present in the mobile phones and to save electricity, time and money. Automation of the home may have ones seemed like a particular and unlikely concept, but as our devices become smarter and more investment is poured into development of IoT consumer products.
Our model is slightly different from the Arduino Type model as our model includes NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller-embedded with WiFi module ESP8266. That makes the model more compact and easier to connect with the house loads. It is cost effective as it includes the microcontroller and wifi embedded in the development board.
IoT device market has undergone radical changes in only a few short years. And home automation is the one where the market is more diverted towards now-a-days. It is one of the build up market and because of their good features, it helps in saving electricity or energy, so everyone wants that system installed in their respective home.
